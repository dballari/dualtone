A block editor WordPress theme based on user patterns—for creators.

== Description ==

DualTone is a two column layout blog with sticky sidebar on the left, as a tribute to b2/cafelog, the origins of WordPress more than 21 years ago, which is also a two column layout blog. It features a content wide page template for legal text, a blank template for creating any type of content layout and several custom block style variations. With a simple and clean design, it lets your readers focus on your content. Includes two theme styles, one bright (the default one) and the other dark (the futuristic dark style).

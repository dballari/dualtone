With a simple and clean design, it lets your readers focus on your content. Includes two theme styles, one bright (the default one) and the other dark (the futuristic dark style). It’s and accessibility ready theme and last but not least, it suggests a new way to deal with template parts and synced user patterns, along with a theme options page to manage patterns in the block inserter, and two companion plugins.

## Demo

You can see the DualTone demo here [DualTone demo](https://ballarinconsulting.com/demo-dualtone) or you can just reproduce the demo site by importing the demo xml file into a clean WordPress installation.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.5++
- PHP 7.0+

## License

- GPL v2

## Getting Started

In order to reproduce the demo site you are adviced to follow the steps explained here:

1. Set up a local WordPress environment or use a hosting provider that allows you to create a test site. Make sure you have the last version of WordPress installed.
2. Install the SAHMI companion plugin that you will find here: [SAHMI plugin—Simply Add Hidden Menu Items](https://github.com/dballari/sahmi).
3. With a clean installation, that is, a WordPress installation that only has the hello world post and the sample page as content, you can just import the xml file you will find in the assets/xml folder of the DualTone theme, using the WordPress import tool. If you have much more content in your WordPress installation the references of some synced patterns or menus may be changed, but it's ok because the SAHMI plugin takes care of this by replacing the references to those ids in your recently imported content.
4. You are done! Enjoy the experience of owning your content and being able to create, manage and publish it.

# DualTone

The DualTone WordPress theme is a two-column (sidebar on the left) blog for creators. It can either be used for content creators or design creators (web designers) or theme creators (web developers), to craft beautiful web pages based on user patterns.

The DualTone theme simplifies content creation by heavily relying on user patterns and assigning a template area in all places of a template where user content may be added.

## Demo

# DualTone

DualTone is a two column layout blog with sticky sidebar on the left, as a tribute to b2/cafelog, the origins of WordPress more than 21 years ago, which is also a two column layout blog. It features a content wide page template for legal text, a blank template for creating any type of content layout and several custom block style variations. With a simple and clean design, it lets your readers focus on your content. Includes several theme styles, a light one (the default one) and a dark one (the futuristic dark style) and some more. Two block sections have been added with contrast and accent color backgrounds. It includes a settings page with some pattern options. It works with WordPress 6.7. Last but not least, check the theme homepage to access a playground demo with the complete demo site content.
